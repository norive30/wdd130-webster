                    Premise of Forage
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Ex-military Grace Sharpe has been working as security captain for 
                    the Marizal corporations space station for the past month. The 
                    job is boring, difficult, and thankless, but she doesn’t have 
                    any other options to turn to. Things take a turn for the worse 
                    though, when the station is attacked by an enemy who seeks 
                    information, and Grace is caught in the crossfire. Using her old 
                    training and her instincts, she defends herself and the workers, 
                    but the enemy gets away with what they sought after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the attack, Grace proves herself to still be capable and is 
                    hired to go along with some of the most dangerous Shadow Hunters 
                    in the universe. They’re tasked with finding the enemy and stopping 
                    whatever it is they are planning to accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now with Grace's weapons, such as her Fragment point, and her newly 
                    found allies, pilot Winny Ecken and robot ZK-33, she will have to 
                    fight through the dangers that the Universe throws at her. Including 
                    the Meteorite army, the terrifying creature of the Pativ asteroids, 
                    and a planet with a storm strong enough to rip a ship in half. All 
                    to discover what their enemy’s plan means for the fate of the entire 
                    Universe, and whether they can be stopped.
                </p>
