        <P>Forage is currently in the crucial, early stages of development, which allows us to focus intensely on building a strong foundation for the narrative. Right now, our primary creative efforts are dedicated to refining the core components of the story: establishing the overarching plot threads, ensuring compelling and satisfying character progression for the main cast, and choreographing the key action sequences to be impactful and memorable. This initial phase is all about making certain that the story’s heart is solid and that the journeys of the characters resonate deeply with the themes we are exploring. This detailed groundwork is essential to ensure a high-quality and cohesive final product.</P>
        <P>In addition to narrative refinement, a major objective at this stage is to finalize the physical world of Forage. We are still working to come to a consensus on the environments of the story, the look, feel, and atmosphere of the crucial settings where the action unfolds. This includes concepting various biomes, architectures, and cultural spaces that will define the project's visual identity. We are committed to a complete and polished experience, and because of this dedication to quality, our goal is to release Forage to the public when we are near its true completion, ensuring that when you finally experience it, it will be the most comprehensive and immersive version possible. It is also worth mentioning that our story is being helmed by a small crew of developers, so it may take a while before we can get the support that we would need. Below, you’ll see the script cover for Forage, which has been in development for quite some time, as well as our lead writer, a major fan of science fiction, who is actively working on the story as we speak.</P>
