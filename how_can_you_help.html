                   While Forage is still taking its first steps, we are actively looking 
                   for passionate individuals to join our growing team. Crucially, as we 
                   are still working to get this project firmly off the ground, we are not 
                   asking for monetary donations of any kind currently. Instead, our greatest 
                   need is for creative talent to help shape the project's visual and 
                   narrative future. We are currently seeking dedicated visual artists, 
                   meticulous storyboard designers, talented script writers, and anyone else 
                   familiar with the unique style and direction required for high-quality 
                   graphic novel creation. If you possess skills in graphic arts, sequential 
                   storytelling, or visual direction, and are excited by the prospect of 
                   contributing to a brand-new universe, we encourage you to reach out and help 
                   us build this world!

                    As noted, without legitimate artistic help, our team members decided to use 
                    AI imagery to show a similar form of artistic aspect that we are going for. 
                    This doesn’t mean we want to use AI for our the art of Forage, but want to use 
                    it for as a tool to create interesting visuals that can help show what our world 
                    would look like.
